# motion-layout

A nice way to use iOS6 autolayout in your RubyMotion app. Basically, use ASCII-art inspired format strings to build your layout.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-layout'

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install motion-layout

## Usage

## TODO

## Contributing

I couldn't figure out how to test this automatically. Run `bundle` to get the gems you need, and then `rake` to generate a RubyMotion app in the iOS simulator

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
